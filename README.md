# Steam-Sentiment-Analysis

This was the second group project completed during my Data Science Masters at UMich. We used the Steam API to collect data on game reviews and create classifaction models that classified positivity of a review based on its context. We also used NLP methods to look into the relationship between review context and positivity from a word association and content perspective. This project was made in Deepnote, and because I am not the admin I don't have a shareable link to provide (sorry!), but here you can read the final report made on our models. It describes our motivations, methodologies, and results:
